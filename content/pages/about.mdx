Welcome to Objective Experience.
My name is Lucas Colusso, and I’m on a mission to learn how to navigate this complex intersection between customer experience, design, and data.
If you’re a designer who have never thought about using data in your work, you’ll find content here that aim to educate, provoke.
If you're a data expert, perhaps you can help me on my journey.

## Why Objective Experience?
As a seasoned user experience designer and researcher, I’ve often found myself relying on both quantitative and qualitative data to make decisions.
To stay relevant in modern organizations, user experience professionals must lead this empirical approach.
Data tools like Power BI have revolutionized numerous professions by providing deep insights and supporting problem-solving.
Yet user experience professionals often remain on the sidelines, contributing ever-diminishing value through their visual design tools.

## What to Expect from This Blog
Objective Experience is both a diary of my personal learning experiences with Power BI and Fabric,
and a repository of actionable advice for those interested in applying data analysis in design. Here’s what you can expect:

- Guides: Step-by-steps on how to analyze user experience data.
- Case Studies: Real-life scenarios where I applied data analytics to experience problems, detailing the process, the findings, and how those findings influenced design decisions.
- Reflections: Updates on my learning journey and how each new piece of knowledge or technique influence my thinking.
- Guest contributions: Insights from professionals who have successfully integrated data analysis into their design workflows, providing you with diverse perspectives and expertise.
